# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple linear regression is simply the extension of simple linear regression, that predicts the value of a dependent variable (sometimes it is called as the outcome, target or criterion variable) on the basis of two or more independent variables (or sometimes, the predictor, explanatory or regressor variables).
Multiple linear regression is a mathematical technique that deploys the relationship among multiple independent predictor variables and a single dependent outcome variable.

The equation of multiple linear regression is expressed as;
 yi=ß0+ ß1 xi1+ ß2 xi2 +........+ ßp xip+ Ø
i=n observations;
yi= dependent variable, 
xi= explanatory variables, here we have “p” predictor variables and “p+1” as total regression parameters.
ß0= y-intercept which is a constant term,
ßp= Slope coefficient for each explanatory variable, and
Ø= residuals (model’s error term), having a normal distribution with mean 0 and constant variance,
